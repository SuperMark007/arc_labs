Introduction
############

This is a handbook for ARC labs which is a part of ARC university courses. The handbook is written
to help students who attend the ARC university course and anyone who is interested in |arc| to
get started in |arc| development. It describes all the basic elements of ARC labs and
how to finish the labs with step-by-step approach.

This handbook can be used as a Lab teaching material for ARC university courses at
undergraduate or graduate level with majors in Commuter Science, Computer
Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or for professional engineers.

This handbook includes 12 labs (more labs are added in the future), which are classified into 3 levels:

* :ref:`Level 1: ARC basic <level1_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the basic topics about |arc|, for example, the
installation and usage of hardware and software tools, software or hardware
development kits, first hello world example, interrupt hanlding and internal timers of |arc|, and so on.

* :ref:`Level 2: ARC advanced <level2_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the advanced topics about |arc|, for example,
Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), customized linkage, compiler optimization,
basic applicaitons, |arc| DSP feature, and so on.

* :ref:`Level 3: ARC exploration <level3_labs>`

The labs in this level cover some complex applications about |arc|, for example,
Internet of Thinggs (IoT) application, embedded machine learning, and so on.

Most of the labs are based on the `embARC Open Software Platform (OSP) <https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp>`__ which is an open
software platform to facilitate the development of embedded systems based on
|arc|.

It is designed to provide a unified platform for |arc| users by defining
consistent and simple software interfaces to the processor and peripherals
together with ports of several well known Free and open-source software (FOSS)
embedded software stacks to |arc|.
